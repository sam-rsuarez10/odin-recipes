    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I first tasted arepas at a New York City hole-in-the-wall eatery and I fell in love with this stuffed white corn cake. Halfway through my first arepa — one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, and salty cheese — I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your favorite fillings. I went with some spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups of P.A.N</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
        </li>
    </ol>
